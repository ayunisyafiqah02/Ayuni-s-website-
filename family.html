<p> To be honest, my family is great. I would like to tell you a little about my family. My father has a bissness carwarsh in Kota Baru Kelantan. My mother is also self-employed by selling baked macaroni and delivering it to sellers. Indeed, we understand the fatigue of our parents who work hard to support us.  Both of their services will not be reciprocated because they are too valuable. My parents were married for 16 years before divorcing when i was 16. I am grateful to have both parents who always care about they children and always want the best for the four of us. I am the only daugther in the family and the first sister of the four siblings .  I always remind to my little brother to study hard so that we can repay the services of both my parents. I know my parents have the same goal of seeing their children grow up and live happily one day. My family is the best family in the world and I love them so much!</p>
