<p> In my university, i have join Cultural Unit Theatre Club. So many activities that i involved from this club which is Malam Bersama Kebudayaan for the last sem. Malam Bersama Kebudayaan is a night where all members of the culture perform to present to the audience. we chose a disney theme for the night and did various performances such as theater performances, singing, dancing and modeling according to the theme.  Me as a crew have to make up the contestants and prepare their clothes to look great.  </p>

<p> Since it was my last semester, I took the opportunity to take part in  all the activities and programs that organized by my club. I have been involved in the "Malam Cinta Rasul" program as a protocol bureau that night and I am very honored and proud to be part of this family. They are very helpful and we have fun together despite the stress with a lot of assignments and work.There was a nasyid and a little tazkirah from ustaz in conjunction with the Maulidur Rasul on that night. The performance was held at Medan Ilmu, Uitm Mcahang. I will cherish this moment forever and they all will be missed!</p>

<p>Cultural Unit Theatre consists of 8 departments which are Music, Crew, Skedsa, theatre, Dikir, Modelling, Seria Serangkai Tari and Eisart. I have joined Crew department since i am in semester 3. These are the crew members who work behind the scenes and are always the backbone of every performance of the cultural unit. Crew has many branches according to student interests, for example, students can join lighting, buying, fashion, props and audio. In this department, I have been appointed as the treasurer and I am responsible for taking care of the club's cash flow. As a final year student, we created so many memories together through this club even though we had a lot of work to do especially on the day of the performance. I am glad beacuse i get so many experience from joining this club such as learned how to handle a big program and ensure that the program runs smoothly</p>
