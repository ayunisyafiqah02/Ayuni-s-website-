<p> In my university, i have join Cultural Unit Theatre Club. So many activities that i involved from this club which is Malam Bersama Kebudayaan for the last sem. Malam Bersama Kebudayaan is a night where all members of the culture perform to present to the audience. we chose a disney theme for the night and did various performances such as theater performances, singing, dancing and modeling according to the theme.  Me as a crew have to make up the contestants and prepare their clothes to look great.  </p>

<p>Cultural Unit Theatre consists of 8 departments which are Music, Crew, Skedsa, theatre, Dikir, Modelling, Seria Serangkai Tari and Eisart. I have joined Crew department since i am in semester 3. These are the crew members who work behind the scenes and are always the backbone of every performance of the cultural unit. Crew has many branches according to student interests, for example, students can join lighting, buying, fashion, props and audio. In this department, I have been appointed as the treasurer and I am responsible for taking care of the club's cash flow. As a final year student, we created so many memories together through this club even though we had a lot of work to do especially on the day of the performance. I am glad beacuse i get so many experience from joining this club such as learned how to handle a big program and ensure that the program runs smoothly</p>
